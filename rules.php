<p><span id="basic" style="font-size:150%"><u><strong>1. BASIC SERVER RULES</strong></u></span></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>ALL RULES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME</li>
<li>No attempting to find cracks within the rules or using excuses to operate within them. Use common sense.</li>
<li>Do not play Altis Life if you are not prepared to lose things from time to time, people make mistakes, this is also a game, try to remember that when talking to a player.</li>
<li>All Admin Decisions / Judgements / Punishments are final. If you disagree with the outcome, you must contest this using the official ban appeal procedure, A server founder can over-ride any Admin decision at any time.</li>
<li>This is a role-play server. You must role-play. Failing to do so is a serious offence and will most likely result in your removal from server. Using bare minimal RP to justify anything is not allowed. This includes the classic 2 seconds to put hands on head or die - This may lead to removal from server depending on administrative judgement.</li>
<li>Use respectable names.</li>
<li>No voice over side chat/police squad chat.</li>
<li>No RDM/VDM. Ever.  Just because someone RDMed you does not mean you can RDM them back. 2 wrongs do not make a right and if you seek revenge you may be subject to punishment also.  If you are the victim of this you must report it.</li>
<li>Combat logging is never allowed. If you disconnect whilst in the middle of a fire-fight/restrained/in active RP it will be considered combat logging.  If you genuinely D/C, you must make every effort to get back to the area as soon as possible and tell the person you was RPing with.  If you die, you must wait until you re-spawn before disconnecting. If a kidney is removed from you for a genuine role play reason. You MUST NOT Re-spawn/kill yourself. You must make every attempt to get a kidney back. Failure to do so is also considered combat logging</li>
<li>Killing a police Negotiator during negotiations is not allowed.</li>
<li>You are considered in a critically injured state until you actually re-spawn.</li>
<li>When claiming a vehicle it will only be storable in your garage once the server is restarted </li>
<li>Police Lights and Sirens are not always an Initiation of Role-play, For Example: If the FED Reserve is being robbed and Police are responding to it with lights on, this does not give you the right to shoot on site unless you are involved with the FED. Police Lights and Sirens are only an Initiation of Role-Play if you are directly involved with the incident.</li>
<li>Anybody found to be Exploiting the XP system will be dealt with according, (Note the Word Exploiting) this includes fight clubbing, damaging and repairing vehicles or anything that is not naturally earned XP.</li>
<br/>

In this case, you must stop, sound your horn, ask them to move, and if they continue to refuse you may then slowly move forward.   Once you have done all you can to request they move, it is up to the civilian on the road to get out of the way.</ul></li>

If you decide to take over one of these checkpoints, you must initiate RP.  You may enforce road tolls/taxes, however if someone pays the charge you place on it, then you must let them pass.  Don\'t be an asshole, if someone decides to pay, let them pay and allow them to be on their way.	If you take a check point, you may not just shoot someone randomly from within it.  Likewise, if you see someone manning the checkpoint, you may not shoot at them while they are inside it without initiating RP. If police are manning the checkpoint and you enter it/ are seen to be avoiding it, They are within right to search you, your vehicle and also check your licenses.</ul></li></p>

<ul>
<li>You may declare war on the government institution of Altis which is represented by the police.  To do so, you need to have a valid reason that has actually occurred.

Things like Police corruption and police brutality are reasons, only however if you or your affiliates have suffered police brutality or feel a victim from an action caused by police corruption.</li>
<li>War is not a reason to shoot unarmed civilians or medics, is it not to be used as a free for all.</li><li>If you die in a war, you do not return to the city until the war is over.</li>
<li>When declaring war, you must state your intentions on side chat, text your intentions via police message and have a minimum of 6 people to declare war.</li>
<li>After declaring war, you must wait 10 minutes.  This is to allow police forces to prepare and to allow civilians to get to safety.</li>
<li>You may not declare war with no intention to do so.  This means that you may not use a deceleration of war as a distraction for you to do the fed etc.</li>
<li>War can only be declared once in each town every server restart</li><li>You may not rob the federal reserve whilst war has been declared and vice versa</li>
<li>Gangs must give a minimum of 5 minutes notice to the police or the gang who's territory they are attacking<li>

<li>You must not harm the police negotiator, however he can be taken hostage in an extreme situation.</li>

<p><span id="Cop" style="font-size:150%"><u><strong>11. POLICE RULES:</strong></u></span></p></ul>
<p><strong><u>Core Rules</u></strong><br />
<li><strong>ROLEPLAY!</strong> 
<li>Not in any case will you break role-play, you also should not be acting as an Admin or Moderator. Deal with people breaking the <strong>LAW</strong> not the <strong>RULES</strong>.</li>
<li>Example for not role-playing: Put your hands up we have guns pointed at you then turn around and start spraying everyone down. Act like you would in real life. Rambo is not real.</li>
<li><strong>Be reasonable</strong>. Always listen to things being said to you. Sending someone to jail will most likely cost them a lot of money and potentially their rebel license.</li>
<li>Any police officer is to follow orders from higher ranking officers at all times. Police Hierarchy must be uphold at all times.When not agreeing with the officer in charge, first do it, talk and question afterwards.</li>
<li><strong>Police officers are to always wear their proper Gear given to them by ranking up (Please remember to sync data, no excuses for not). Wearing gear not suited for your rank or situation is strictly prohibited. Higher ranked gear is only allowed when issued to you by a higher ranking officer of Captain or Higher as a reward, In most cases this will be temporary and will need to be returned unless otherwise stated. Being a member of SWAT or DEA does not mean you can use what weapon you like or wear what you like, Only use your Equipment / Vehicles when on SWAT / DEA duty and not for normal Police matters, SWAT should not have silencers on their weapons unless performing Actual SWAT duty.</strong> </li>
<li>Police officers always need probable cause to pull over, question or restrain a citizen. Example for probable cause: See a truck driving from the weed fields, you can pull them over to search their truck for drugs.</li>
<li>All active cops must be in TeamSpeak within the police channels and follow the guide at the bottom of the police rules on team-speak etiquette.</li>
<li>Police can call on the assistance of the Logistics Company ARC and the Armed Hellcat if they feel overwhelmed, if Rebels are using an Armed Off-road or if they have Air superiority that ground units can not deal with, The Hellcat can be flown at any time of the day but the weapons should only ever be used in extreme circumstances or if Ordered by a Captain or above.
<li>Police may raid the houses within a town as long as they provide at least 5 minutes warning to the respective Player.</li>
<li>The following speeds are to be enforced by the Altis Police Force for the absolute safety of the citizens of Kavala and all travelling beyond the city.</li>
<br/>
<li>Inside major cities:</li>
<li>Small roads: 50km/h</li>
<li>Main roads: 65km/h</li>
<br/>
<li>Outside major cities:</li>
<li>Small roads: 80km/h</li>
<li>Main roads: 110km/h</li>
</ul>
</p>
 <p><u><strong>Role-play</strong></u><br />
As a member of the Prophecy Gaming Police Department you will try to uphold the law to the best of your abilities. Do not use your position as a cop to deal with server rules and issues. If in any case you break any server rules yourself, you will be dealt accordingly like every other player on the server. If you see any player breaking server rules, you will have to come up with proof like every other player on the server.</p><p>Use your position as a cop to set the good example for everyone on the Prophecy Gaming <br />
server. <u>Always role-play, and never abuse your position of power.</u>

</p>
<p><u><strong>Interaction and Arresting Citizens</strong></u><br />
All interaction with any kind of citizen will always go by PGPD RP rules.<br />
If any citizen breaks any law they will be held responsible and dealt with accordingly.</p>
<p><u><strong>Dealing with law breaking citizen:</strong></u><br />
<ul>
<li>Tell them to stop what they are doing. Give them the opportunity to surrender peacefully.</li>
<li>If they are unwilling to comply, you are allowed to use necessary force to bring them in.</li>
<li>Clearly tell them what & why you’re doing and what will happen next.</li>

</ul></p>
<p><u><strong>Vehicle Traffic law & Summary Offences:</strong></u><br />
When a Vehicle Traffic law has been broken or a Summary Offence has been committed, issue the suspect the appropriate ticket and give them opportunity to pay.  If they refuse 2x you can send them to jail. Clearly tell them why they are being sent to jail.</p><p><u><strong>Indictable Offense:</strong></u><br />
Once arrested they will be taken to a Police HQ for processing. After committing a Felony the criminal will be sent to jail. Jail time will depend on the height of the bounty.<br />
<em><span style="color:#4e4e4e">$0 (no bounty) = 15minutes in jail<br />
$1 - $24.999 = 20minutes in jail<br />
$25.000 - $49.999 = 25minutes in jail<br />
$50.000 and higher = 30minutes in jail</span></em><br />
Paying a ticket will set the bounty price to $0, paying actually decreases your jail time! Give them the opportunity to request Coffee and Donuts before sending them off to jail (no <br />
need to offer). <span style="color:#4e4e4e"><em>For roleplay purposes ticket prices can be negotiable, going to jail however is not negotiable.</em></span></p><p><u><strong>Tickets & Bounty’s</strong></u><br />
All tickets paid after any crime will go directly into the bank account of the officer dealing with the case. All bounty prices will be added to the bank account of the officer who sends he criminal to jail. For every crime Ticket & Bounty prices are the same.</p>
<p><u><strong>Reviving</strong></u><br />
Police officers can revive another officer once every 15 minutes, the same as medic rules. Seriously injured criminals can be revived in order to arrest them. Cops however are not medics and will not travel across the map to provide medical assistance.</p><p><u><strong>Impounding Vehicles</strong></u><br />
Any vehicle that appears to be left behind can be impounded by the police. Whether or not the vehicle should be impounded is judged by the highest ranking officer on scene.<br />
<strong>- Do not impound any vehicles while active roleplay is initiated.</strong><br />
Vehicles used in criminal activities can be destroyed at the discretion of the highest ranking police officer on at the time. </p>
<p><u><strong>Team-speak</strong></u><br />
You do not mute your speaker on Team-speak. When clear comms are needed let everyone know! You do mute your microphone when speaking in game. This can easily be done in the <br />
Team-speak settings: SETTING > OPTION > HOTKEYS > Set:<br />
CAPSLOCK (down) - MUTE MICROPHONE<br/>
CAPSLOCK (up) - UNMUTE MICROPHONE<br/>
</p><p><span id="Med" style="font-size:150%"><u><strong>12. MEDIC RULES:</strong></u></span></p><p><ul>
<li>You may only revive a player once in a 15 minute time scale </li><li>You cannot pick up or wear any equipment that is not available to you in the medic store. This includes weaponry/clothing etc</li>
<li>You must be in the medic teamspeak channel at all times </li><li>Cops should be revived before rebels.  Although you are not to take sides, you must allow police to restore order to an area.  Reviving rebels while in a fire fight cops would not help and as such, during an active fire-fight you should see police permission before entering an active combat zone.</li>
<li>You may not give out information such as enemy position to other players. Doing this will be seen as meta gaming and may result in your removal from the server.</ul></li>
</p><p><span id="FAQ" style="font-size:150%"><u><strong>12. FAQ</strong></u></span></p><p><u><strong>What can I be banned for?</strong></u></p><p>Prophecy gaming staff members may issue out bans for the following reasons.<br />
<ul>
<li>Hacking / Cheating / Exploiting / Glitching / Duping</li><li>RDM & VDM</li><li>EMS are NOT to be killed, attacked or taken hostage without RP reason.</li><li>Racism (We operate a zero tolerance policy on racism and racial slurs)</li><li>Abuse</li><li>Trolling</li><li>Collective Admin Discretion </ul></li></p><p>More to be added.</p>
